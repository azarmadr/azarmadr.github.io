## Game Development

### Avalanche Tetris
Made a combined game of Tetris with 3's/2048 for bevy jam#2. It is not yet feature complete, but can be played nonetheless. I only had 2 days to finish the game.

### Oware
My most recent game with bevy. I discovered `oware`  recently in `G-Compris`. It was a fascinating small game. So I started working on it. First i implemented the game logic in [board-game](https://crates.io/crates/board-game) crate, which already has bots (monte-carlo tree search, random, ...) ready for games that implement its traits. Then i made the game in bevy.

Sometimes i get distracted while thinking how to find smallest possible game, or how to spot a draw game in Oware.
